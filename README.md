## Overview of the Analysis

 ***PURPOSE:***
 This analysis assesses the creditworthiness of borrowers using various supervised learning methodologies.
 
 ***DATA:***
 This analysis utilizes lending data from a peer-to-peer lending company.
 
 The data consist of various loan statistics (the features) and a loan assessment (the target):
   **FEATURES**
      loan_size
      interest_rate
      borrower_income
      debt_to_income
      num_of_accounts
      derogatory_marks
      total_debt
      
   **TARGET**
      loan_status

The loan dataset contains info on over 77,000 loans:

 Given the information contained in features, we look to be able to predict the loan_status and assess loan risk.
 
 

* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
